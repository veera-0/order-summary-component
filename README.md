## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid



### What I learned

By creating this order summary, I have worked with css deeply and these require more knowldege on the properties and the alignments of the components in HTML and I have struggled at first then I have adopted on how to deal with the CSS and work with them.
It's a great experience for me.
